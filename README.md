# NFT Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

--> There is using the pinata for storing images 

--> set your public_key, Private_key and api_url of alchemy in .env file

want to show the nft in your wallet :
1.   install node modules
2.   compile and deploy smart contract with using above hardhat command 
3.   run the mint-nft file using "node mint-nft.js"
4.   it shows transaction hash and block id
5.   so, finally put the contract address and block id  in metamask nft section.
